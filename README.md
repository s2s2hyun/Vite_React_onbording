Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a new breed of frontend build tooling that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists of two major parts:

A dev server that serves your source files over native ES modules, with rich built-in features and astonishingly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

In addition, Vite is highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing support.
